# WebScraper-for-Chicago-Construction-Projects

Requirements to run the program are Python 3 and BeautifulSoup, and two e-mail adresses.

To run the program, download it, then in the folder were the "chicago-webscraper.py" is, hold Shift and right-click, then click "Open Command Prompt Window here" and type "python chicago-webscraper.py"

This code scrapes a site to search for new commercial projects in the Chicago area. 

If you want to run the program make sure to have the files ('nr_of_industrial.txt' and 'nr_of_office') with 0 in them everytime, to see how it works.

I use this code and the website which I scraped, for python learning purposes only.
